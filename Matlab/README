This folder contains matlab codes to create lammps data files for the lattice model simulations with magentic forces.
The profiles of the magnetic residual flux are coded inside the "functions" folder. Therefore, each example will have slighlty different parts in the functions.
This is only for the magnetic force calculations. For the lammps data file, all the examples use the same functions.
